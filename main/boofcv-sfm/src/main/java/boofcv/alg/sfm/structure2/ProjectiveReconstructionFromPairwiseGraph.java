/**
 * Given a {@link PairwiseImageGraph2} that describes how a set of images are related to each other based on point
 * features, compute a projective reconstruction of the camera matrices for each view. The reconstructed location
 * of scene points are not saved.
 *
 * Summary of approach:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Input: {@link PairwiseImageGraph2}</li>
 *     <li>Select images/views to act as seeds</li>
 *     <li>Pick the first seed and perform initial reconstruction from its neighbors and common features</li>
 *     <li>For each remaining unknown view with a 3D relationship to a known view, find its camera matrix</li>
 *     <li>Stop when no more valid views can be found</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * In the future multiple seeds will be used to reduce the amount of error which accumulates as the scene spreads out
 * from its initial location
 *
